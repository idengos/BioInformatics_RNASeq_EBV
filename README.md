For Summer Bioinformatics Fellowship at the RNA Institute UAlbany.

Investigated the Epstein-Barr Virus' ability to lead to lymphomas using RNA-Seq. Data anyalysis was done using R.

There is a nice R notebook PDF with all the code and graphs that is very easy to follow along with.

(./STAR folder was too large to upload.)
